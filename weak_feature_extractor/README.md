# Details

Fork from the official github for the "Knowledge Transfer From Weakly Labeled Audio Using Convolutional Neural Network For Sound Events And Scenes" paper. https://github.com/anuragkr90/weak_feature_extractor

The only differences are that this is adapted to python3 and for our use case. For citations always cite the original work https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01369.pdf
